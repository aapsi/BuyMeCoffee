# Steps

-> Create a folder BuyMeCoffe in VS code

-> Open terminal and install Hardhat
    npm install --save-dev hardhat
    npx hardhat init
    npm install --save-dev "hardhat@^2.17.4" "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox@^3.0.0"

-> Now write your smart contract under the contracts folder

-> Now, lets make changes to deploy.js under the scripts folder

-> first we will deploy our smart contract on hardhat node then later on testnet
    -> hardhat is a blockchain that works like local blockchain

-> Now we will check if our smart contract is working properly or not
